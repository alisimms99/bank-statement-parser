# ============================================================================
# Environment Configuration for Bank Statement Parser
# ============================================================================
#
# This file documents all available environment variables for local development
# and production deployment.
#
# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:
#   Copy this file to `.env.local` and fill in your values.
#   The application reads variables directly from `.env.local`.
#
# PRODUCTION (Cloud Run + Secret Manager):
#   DO NOT use .env files in production. Instead:
#   1. Store all secrets in Google Cloud Secret Manager
#   2. Use the deployment scripts: ./scripts/create-secrets.sh and ./scripts/deploy-cloud-run.sh
#   3. Cloud Run mounts secrets as files or environment variables automatically
#
# FILE-BASED SECRETS:
#   The application supports the `<NAME>_FILE` convention for reading secrets from files.
#   Example: If `JWT_SECRET_FILE=/secrets/jwt` exists, the app reads from that file.
#   This is the Cloud Run Secret Manager pattern.
#
# See docs/SECRET_MANAGER.md for complete deployment instructions.

### Deployment Configuration
# Server port (Cloud Run sets this automatically in production)
PORT=8080

### Authentication & Security
# JWT secret for signing session cookies (REQUIRED for production)
JWT_SECRET=
# Production (Cloud Run + Secret Manager): Use JWT_SECRET_FILE to mount from Secret Manager

# CORS allowlist (comma-separated). Examples:
# - Single origin: https://my-app.web.app
# - Multiple: https://my-app.web.app,https://my-app.firebaseapp.com
# - Any origin (no credentials): *
CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN=
# Production (Cloud Run + Secret Manager): Use CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN_FILE to mount from Secret Manager

### Database (Optional)
# Database connection string - only required if using database features
DATABASE_URL=
# Production (Cloud Run + Secret Manager): Use DATABASE_URL_FILE to mount from Secret Manager

### Document AI Configuration
# Google Cloud Project ID where Document AI is enabled
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=
# Production (Cloud Run + Secret Manager): Use GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID_FILE to mount from Secret Manager

# Document AI processor location (e.g., us, eu, asia-northeast1)
DOCAI_LOCATION=us
# Production (Cloud Run + Secret Manager): Use DOCAI_LOCATION_FILE to mount from Secret Manager

# Document AI processor ID (single processor fallback for all document types)
DOCAI_PROCESSOR_ID=
# Production (Cloud Run + Secret Manager): Use DOCAI_PROCESSOR_ID_FILE to mount from Secret Manager

# Toggle Document AI processing (true/false) - This is NOT a secret, set directly
ENABLE_DOC_AI=false

# Service account credentials for Document AI authentication
# Local development: Provide JSON string (base64 or plain) or file path
GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=
GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=
# Production (Cloud Run + Secret Manager): Use GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_FILE to mount from Secret Manager
# The app automatically reads from the mounted file path

### Client (Vite)
# If UI and API are hosted separately, set an absolute origin (e.g. https://api.example.com)
VITE_API_URL=

### Backwards-compatible aliases (still supported)
GCP_PROJECT_ID=
GCP_LOCATION=us
DOC_AI_BANK_PROCESSOR_ID=
DOC_AI_INVOICE_PROCESSOR_ID=
DOC_AI_OCR_PROCESSOR_ID=
DOC_AI_FORM_PROCESSOR_ID=
